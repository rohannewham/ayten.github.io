                        <h3>Normative Social Influence: Paying to Belong</h3>

                    Keeping up with the Joneses suggests an urge to jump on a bandwagon simply because everyone else has. In psychological terms this is referred to as normative social influence, a way of conformity to a group so you do not feel left out. As humans we are mostly social beings and being ostracised is a form of punishment, so normative social influence is the currency we pay to fit in. Despite being invisible it impacts our lives daily, however is the price worth the cost of acceptance?
                </div>
                <div class="extra-content" style="display: none;">
                    <p>                        
                        In 1951 social psychologist Solomon Asch conducted an experiment to see whether people would go against their better judgement simply to conform to a group. A participant was placed in a room full of confederates and asked questions where the confederates would all answer wrong. Asch wanted to see if the participant would knowingly answer wrong simply to fit in. In 75% of the cases of the participants went against their own answers to fit in with a group. This tells us the power of normative social influence since the fear of being rejected and the need for approval is more important than the truth. Not just that but it’s a very surface level of conformity with it being more about the appearance of belonging.
                        
                        Conformity refers to changing oneself to fit in a group, almost like taking out a loan for acceptance. The interest rates being loss of authenticity and occasionally anxiety. An example worrying about saying the wrong thing, wearing the wrong clothes because it’s not ‘the done thing’. This can lead to staying awake at 3am replaying conversations, your interest rate here would be paying for approval with your peace of mind. Even more distressing is losing your authentic self and starting to transform into a crowd-pleasing doll eventually leading to a complete loss of identity. Sometimes even wondering ‘should I go along’ is signing away your own self to belong at someone else's table. Most people do conform because the sanctions such as rejection are too high a price.
                        
                        Normative social influence has many positive sides such as social cohesion, value consensus and peaceful interactions with those around us. Without it there would be chaos, with it we have a reduction on the mental load because we know how to behave. It’s almost like our autopilot in society, and it would be a lie to say we don’t all thrive on being liked. That sense of belonging that leads to emotional bonding making us feel like we are part of a group whether it’s a football team or a friendship group is important for our mental wellbeing. And let’s be serious not everything needs to be a debate, sometimes it’s better to keep things to ourselves just to have pleasant conversations such as at work. It allows us all the live together in somewhat harmony. Yes, it can suppress creativity and individuality and, in the past, has created negative groupthink but generally it does have its place in society.
                        
                        In the world we are living in today social media puts Normative Social Influence in a magnifying glass. Think about the likes and follows sometimes we are literally quite
                        
                        figuratively paying to belong. The latest gadgets or the trendiest outfit, we are receiving push notifications so we can literally belong. There is a new way to gain social approval, and we are literally curating ourselves to be liked. Think about it TikTok trends, Instagram likes all this is like an invisible code to get literal likes. Normative social influence has not just adapted to this current digital age it has thrived and grown.
                        
                        This raises a question whether we pay this debt and continue to conform or do we embrace authenticity and dare to stand apart. A healthy society requires both, we do need to conform to some social rules however personal freedom in a world that encourages conformity is an act of courage. It’s how individuality thrives and in a way it how you get paid back with people who fit your character more and with a sense of personal peace even if it means sitting alone.
                        
                        You don’t need to put own personality into an overdraft because while normative social influence is powerful with its own benefits being real is worth the price. It won’t get you likes or group invitations, but it does mean self-respect. And people who will stand by you will be the ones who like you for standing in the world as yourself.  .</p>

                        <h3>Semantic Memory in the Age of AI</h3>
                        <span class="chat-time">5 hours ago</span>

                    Paris is the capital of France. We know this, but who remembers the moment they learnt this? My guess is very few. 
                    The semantic memory, which is a part of the long-term memory, a part of the mind that holds an infinite amount of information
                     indefinitely. It holds factual and conceptual knowledge such as the names of the planets, capital cities or horoscopes. 
                     It’s endless however where and when you learnt that knowledge is not stored with the semantic memory. 
                     Tulving (1972) mentioned that that the semantic memory was the brains very own encyclopaedia, you know how to make a cup of 
                     tea, but you don’t know when you learnt it. 🌅
                </div>
                <div class="extra-content" style="display: none;">
                    <p> Now in the age of ai we are reaching out to our technical friends like Google or ChatGPT instead of learning them ourselves, something that is coined as cognitive offloading. Most people in the modern age know where to find information rather than teaching it to themselves. Humans going from knowing information to knowing how to navigate information and this means people are less likely to retain information for themselves because why would they? Just a quick search and everything is on your fingertips.

                        Everyone is guilty of this, who hasn’t wanted to find the date of an event and instead of thinking about has gone straight to their phone to research it. Sometimes instead learning it we ask the same questions again and again because we don’t need to commit it to memory. On a negative light this means as humans we are trusting our own recalls less and less and the semantic memory becomes weaker, and we hold less information in our minds. A consequence of this is when faced with anything we are less likely to factually evaluate it and critically analyse it because we don’t have the facts.
                        
                        The broader implications of this are to students and professionals who are moving on from memorising information to knowing where to find it for the moment they need it and probably forgetting it afterwards. There is a popular meme about people who had their degree before ChatGPT, it can be seen a statement on knowledge. On the semantic memory not being used as it used to be, and those who did memorise facts to have an advantage over those that do not. However, there is a very real worry that is every decision post the ai age is just surface level, if the internet happens to be down then that knowledge is exceptionally fragile. A very real worry to those professions that rely on fast critical thinking, especially if we are relying on skimming and skipping information that does not relate to us.
                        
                        Let’s go further along with this, if we rely on ai for everything point of the long-term memory would diminish. Will the future generation know less when recalling information because they know more about relying on different access routes to information? Or will we just free up mental space on more higher thinking and creativity and problem solving which even ai can not replicate truly. This means that like a computer our brain will free up space so decisions and learning can happen quicker. As
                        
                        humans our brains will learn new skills such as navigation. It may redefine our minds and progress the memory, instead of being more individualistic our minds will be part of a hive of digital connections.
                        
                        When looking at the location of the semantic memory is said to be formed in temporal lobe, a part of the brain associated with speaking, comprehension and memories where the hippocampus resides. However, various other studies have located it across the neocortex making it still a heavily debated subject. Most of the results have come from studies of neurodegenerative patients especially amnesic ones who have lost their episodic memory but still retain their semantic memory. In simple terms they remember the facts like word formation and the written word however they cannot remember their own autobiographical events. All this suggesting that the semantic memory is located separately from the episodic memory in the brain and damage to one would not mean damage to the other. The other parts of the long-term memory such as episodic memory and the procedural memory have a similar storage and capacity. The episodic memory being the autobiography of a person and the procedural being the muscle memory.
                        
                        Now the episodic and semantic memory can be blurred, imagine a lecture from university a person would remember the event but also what was taught. It’s far too reductionist to suggest that they are separate because the mind is a messy book with no real separate chapters. Ai is a very clean book; however, its semantic memory is perfectly organised and there is no episodic memory. In cognition it’s often stated that the mind is like a computer where our sensory receptors input the information into our memory. Ai could be said to be a large, organised and perfectly documented library of semantic memory inputted from vast datasets. It does not have lived experiences but processes data with a level of precision not given to people. This means your semantic knowledge would be ever changing, facts will be learnt via emotions and experience having the idiographic richness of lived experience.
                        
                        The limitations of using ai especially when trying to obtain facts would be the problem of blurred boundaries. Ai can lose nuances, and it lacks episodic meaning even though it remembers past conversations and adapts the conversation to relate. This could say to make it more trustworthy or less because human’s semantic memory is mixed with their personal experience. This depends entirely on how you look at it, the human mind is not objective and is tainted by various biases and prejudices. However, ai cannot conceptualise meaning that some human nuances are lost, raising the question whether it is ethical to rely on ai entirely for facts. We can see there is a clear difference between artificial intelligence and human intelligence, and this especially comes into play when thinking about those who use ai as a therapist.
                        
                        Semantic memory is vital for us to conceptualise the world and the knowledge it provides about the world we live in by being a reward for the facts and the individual
                        
                        perceptions that we have. We are moving forward however, and the idea of the semantic memory is moving forward as well and becoming something, we all share and can search. This article is not a matter of whether this is a good or bad thing but to how will our thinking change? Will wisdom and understanding become part of a historical perspective or simply develop to incorporate navigation of search engines and lighten our mental load. Some knowledge is worth memorising because it helps us shape the world around us and it helps us respond to the problems that we have. It may not be as meaningful as the episodic memory but knowing something whether it is academic or not still matters. Ai is an ally to our thinking, something that enhances our knowledge and brings new dimensions to it giving the potential to give us more and to prompt our curiosity. This is a new world but let’s make sure we are still the lead singers.</p>

                        <h3>Why Your Mind Can't Hold That Thought: Short Term Memory and Mindfulness</h3>
                        <span class="chat-time">1 day ago</span>
                    </div>

                    If you have ever left your keys in the door or gone back to check if your hair straighteners were unplugged, 
                    you have faced a dilemma with your short-term memory. Thoughts sometimes just slip through the fingers like 
                    water and why is that? Baddeley and Hitch (1974) may have an answer to that question with the working memory 
                    model, a guide to the short-term memory. They created a model for the short-term memory.
                </div>
                <div class="extra-content" style="display: none;">
                    <p>In simple terms the working memory model consists of the central executive who is like the CEO of model managing the attention and the cognitive resources. It also consists of the phonological loop the system dealing with the voice and the sound part of the memory, the visuospatial sketchpad the system which is the mental canvas dealing with the visual part of the memory. There is also the episodic buffer which acts as an intermediary between the short term and long-term memory. The working memory is woefully short, and most people can only remember 7 plus or minus two things a day. After that the capacity is full, so the idea that we are constantly taking information throughout the day is a debatable topic.

                        Mindfulness looks at the now, accepting the feelings and emotions, it has proven benefits in improving mental wellbeing. It’s the perfect way to relieve past problems without living out previous traumas. However, imagine if your working memory is full and you can not pay attention to anything else. This is when the mind starts to wander, and you forget things otherwise known as cognitive overload. What mindfulness does it is calm the noise around a person thereby reducing the cognitive load. It also improves the working memory allowing for better attention. In a full circle moment, the working memory is needed for mindfulness especially attention but working memory also improves with mindfulness.
                        
                        Where does this all go wrong? In today's world we are inundated with constant noise from social media, phones and just multitasking through meetings, the commute, and daily life in general. We believe we are getting a handle on things and managing everything, but we are only doing one thing and doing it badly at that. This brings into the myth of multitasking, if we learn roughly 7 things a day how much of the day is being retained. If we concentrate on thing at a time, we gain better results and the outcomes for that task are better.
                        
                        Executive dysfunction refers to impairments in self-regulation, we need executive functions to plan and focus. When these start to falter you will find yourself forgetting information, someone asks you a question and your mind will go blank. Transitions will be difficult to regulate because that would involve adapting which also requires an executive function. This can also manifest in interrupting others, blurting things out because without regulation the automatic responses get activated. And given enough
                        
                        stressors or daily hassles this can lead to being stressed and overwhelmed, the literal meltdown over spilt milk.
                        
                        Mindfulness is a way to reclaim that mental space that is overburdened by life. This can be something as simple as cognitive decluttering like a phone detox day, journaling or even yoga. It a not about doing less but about doing one thing better and more than a multitude of things. Everyone has the to-do list or the 3am self-criticism playing out like a bad movie on repeat however by singling them out, writing them on a piece of paper is enough to loosen its grip on you. If get’s too much a walk even for ten minutes can help support or even doing the hardest thing of all, absolutely nothing. Boredom is underrated; it is where ideas come into play and creativity takes place. And despite cognition being all about the mind as a computer and everything needs to be inputted, why not start offloading information via writing a journal or even just having a conversation.
                        
                        Most of our days are spent reacting to the environment around us, sometimes to problems that do not even concern us or involve us in anyway. This leads to a cognitive overload in our working memory, but this can be improved in reclaiming our time and focus. It can seem like a rebellious act; it anchors us to the present moment allowing us to take everything in and allowing us a moment to breathe. We need to remember that every juggling act is the working memory being pushed to the absolute limit and we need that pause to reflect and begin again this time in focus. </p>
